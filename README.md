# Creating-Digital-Painting-Lighting-Effects-via-RGB-space-Geometry-and-Deep-Learning
This project presents a solution to relighting drawings, comparing deep learning with traditional methods (Mathematical). Where the traditional plots image pixels in 3D space, generates a convex hull using the pixels as vertices, calculates convex centroid and casts a ray towards calculated directions and generate intersections, produces stroke density map, normalizes original image to reduce noise and generate coarse-lighting effects, refines the last output to ensure shading matches intensities, and lastly multiplies refinements for the result. Whereas Deep learning model generates four images with different lighting effects.
